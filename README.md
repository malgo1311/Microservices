# Microservices

I have done three labs in my course CS 677 Distributed and Operating Systems at Umass Amherst. Following are the goals achieved in each of the labs.

## Lab 1

1) Designed a distributed client-server applications
2) Designed a concurrent networked server application
3) Designed our own thread pool for servers and use thread pool abstractions provided by
   major languages
4) Designed a distributed applications using a low-level abstraction of socket communication as
   well as high-level abstraction of remote procedure calls.
5) Learn to use gRPC, a modern RPC framework
6) Learn to measure the performance of a distributed application
7) Learn to use version control and build tools

## Lab 2

1. Designed distributed server applications using a multi-tier architecture and microservices.
2. Designed virtualized applications.
3. Designed interfaces for web applications.

4. Implemented a REST API server from scratch
5. Performed performance measurement of th distributed application
6. Used Docker to containerize your micro-service, and learn to manage an application
   consisting of multiple containers using Docker Compose
7. Tested the distributed application

## Lab 2

1. Implemented caching, replication, and consistency.
2. Ensured fault tolerance and high availability.
3. Deployed the application on the AWS
