# Microservices

I have done three labs in my course CS 677 Distributed and Operating Systems at Umass Amherst. Following are the goals achieved in each of the labs. For solutions please go through the README.md inside the src folders, which are present inside each lab.

## Lab 1

1) Designed a distributed client-server applications
2) Designed a concurrent networked server application
3) Designed our own thread pool for servers and use thread pool abstractions provided by
   major languages
4) Designed a distributed applications using a low-level abstraction of socket communication as
   well as high-level abstraction of remote procedure calls.
5) Used gRPC communication protocol, a modern RPC framework
6) Measured the performance of a distributed application

## Lab 2

1. Designed distributed server applications using a multi-tier architecture and microservices.
2. Designed virtualized applications.
3. Designed interfaces for web applications.

4. Implemented a REST API server from scratch
5. Performed performance measurement of th distributed application
6. Used Docker to containerize your micro-service, and learn to manage an application
   consisting of multiple containers using Docker Compose
7. Tested the distributed application

## Lab 3

1. Implemented caching, replication, and consistency.
2. Ensured fault tolerance and high availability.
3. Deployed the application on the AWS
