# README

Added source code to this directory. Part 1 is in *part1* directory and Part 2 is in *part2* directory

Team Members: Aishwarya Malgonde, Sahil Jindal

We owned each part individually - Aishwarya owned part1 and Sahil owned part2. We created our own branches and worked on them, and at the end, we merged them into the main branch. While working on our parts, we parallely brainstormed our approaches and collaborated on any issues and errors we encountered. We also worked on the documentation together and validated each other's contribution. Overall we ensured that both of us had a good understanding of the workings of both parts.

To run code your machine should have `python3` and `pip3` installed

### Install Dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Steps to run the system are in the `README.md` file inside the part1 and part2 folders
